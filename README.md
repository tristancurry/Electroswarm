# Electroswarm

Electroswarm is an attempt to allow you to see for yourself - what if we had three kinds of charge instead of two?

It's a particle simulation where the strength and direction of interaction between three different particle species can be controlled.
The charge and mass of the particle species can also be adjusted.

I nearly described it as an electrostatics simulation, as the underlying mathematics would suggest, but too many things are moving, but it's not really an electrodynamics simulation either.
